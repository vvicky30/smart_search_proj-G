    #gpt-3.5-turbo is the name of a specific variant of OpenAI's GPT-3 model.
    #gpt-3.5-turbo excels at understanding and generating human-like text, 
    # making it suitable for tasks like text completion, summarization, translation, and question-answering.

Tokens are the units of text that the GPT-3 model processes. A token can be as short as one character or as long as one word. 
For example, the word "GPT-3" is one token, and the phrase "OpenAI's GPT-3" consists of four tokens.
When you send a query to the GPT-3 model, the text is broken down into tokens. The model processes these tokens to generate a response.
Token Limit:Each model has a limit on the number of tokens it can process in a single request. For gpt-3.5-turbo, the limit is typically 4096 tokens,
which includes both the input tokens (your prompt) and the output tokens (the model's response).

Model Usage: When you make API calls, you specify which model you want to use in your requests. Your credits will be used according to the model's pricing and the number of tokens processed.

we don’t typically need to purchase each model separately; instead, we can use our credits to access any of the models available in the API, 
with pricing varying depending on the model and amount of usage (in tokens including tokens of input & output as well).
Always check OpenAI’s current pricing and model details for the most accurate information.
